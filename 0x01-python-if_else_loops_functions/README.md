# 0x01 Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, we explore fundamental concepts in Python programming, including if/else statements, loops, and functions. The tasks aim to reinforce the understanding of these concepts, such as using indentation, conditional statements, loops, and defining functions. Below are the descriptions of each task and the corresponding Python scripts:

## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This script assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

- [0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py)

## 1. The last digit
This script assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints the last digit of that number along with specific conditions.

- [1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py)

## 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
This script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase on a single line.

- [2-print_alphabet.py](./2-print_alphabet.py)

## 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
This script prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', on a single line.

- [3-print_alphabt.py](./3-print_alphabt.py)

## 4. Hexadecimal printing
This script prints numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.

- [4-print_hexa.py](./4-print_hexa.py)

## 5. 00...99
This script prints numbers from 0 to 99 with a specific format.

- [5-print_comb2.py](./5-print_comb2.py)

## 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
This script prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

- [6-print_comb3.py](./6-print_comb3.py)

## 7. islower
This function checks if a character is lowercase.

- [7-islower.py](./7-islower.py)

## 8. To uppercase
This function prints a string in uppercase.

- [8-uppercase.py](./8-uppercase.py)

## 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
This function prints the last digit of a number.

- [9-print_last_digit.py](./9-print_last_digit.py)

## 10. a + b
This function adds two integers and returns the result.

- [10-add.py](./10-add.py)

## 11. a ^ b
This function computes a to the power of b and returns the result.

- [11-pow.py](./11-pow.py)

## 12. Fizz Buzz
This function prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific conditions.

- [12-fizzbuzz.py](./12-fizzbuzz.py)

## 13. Insert in sorted linked list
This C program inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

- [13-insert_number.c](./13-insert_number.c)
- [lists.h](./lists.h)
