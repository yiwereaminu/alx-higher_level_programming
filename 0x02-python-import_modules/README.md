# 0x02. Python - Import Modules

This repository contains Python programs that showcase the use of importing functions and modules, working with command line arguments, and handling different tasks.

## Files:

### 0-add.py
This program imports the `add` function from `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition of 1 and 2.

### 1-calculation.py
A script that imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on given values.

### 2-args.py
A program that prints the number and list of its command line arguments.

### 3-infinite_add.py
A script that prints the result of the addition of all command line arguments.

### 4-hidden_discovery.py
This program prints all names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`, excluding names starting with "__".

### 5-variable_load.py
A script that imports a variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

### 100-my_calculator.py
An advanced program that imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs basic operations based on command line input.

### 101-easy_print.py
An advanced script that prints `#pythoniscool` without using print, eval, open, or import sys.

### 102-magic_calculation.py
An advanced Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` that replicates a given Python bytecode.

### 103-fast_alphabet.py
An advanced program that prints the uppercase alphabet in a single line without using loops, conditional statements, str.join(), string literals, or system calls.

## Requirements

- All programs should be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Code should use the PEP 8 style guide (checked with pycodestyle version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The first line of each file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
